Mount different FastAPI apps for different routes:
Following the same rules of mounting different WSGI applications for different routes, you can also mount different FastAPI applications within the FastAPI application. This would mean that every sub-FastAPI application would have its docs, would run independent of other applications, and will handle its path-specific requests. To mount this, simply create a master application and sub-application file. Now, import the app object from the sub-application file to the master application file and pass this object directly to the mount function of the master application object. This workaround doesnâ€™t require any middleware. See an example below:

Below are the contents for the apiv1.py file (sub-application 1):[Code for sub-application 1]

from fastapi import FastAPI


apiv1 = FastAPI()

@apiv1.get('/name')
def index():
    return {"Name": "Rohit Ghawale"}



And here is the code for the apiv2.py file (sub-application 2): [Code for sub-application 2]

from fastapi import FastAPI


apiv2 = FastAPI()

@apiv2.get('/location')
def index():
    return {"Location": "India"}


Now, we can mount both of these sub-applications in the master application. See the code for the master.py file: [code for The master application code where both sub-applications are mounted]

from fastapi import FastAPI
from apiv1 import apiv1
from apiv2 import apiv2
import uvicorn

app = FastAPI()
app.mount("/api/v1", apiv1)
app.mount("/api/v2", apiv2)


@app.get('/')
def index():
    return "Hello"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    uvicorn.run("master:app", host='127.0.0.1', port=8000, reload=True)



If you make requests to respective paths endpoints, the request will be handled by those sub-applications.


Here both the requests were served by respective applications at endpoint as 127.0.0.1:8001/api/v1/name , 127.0.0.1:8001/api/v2/location
